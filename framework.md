# Challenges
Challenges encountered by CS instructors and CS students in undergraduate proof-based courses along with the number of instructors and students that mentioned each challenge. The challenges mentioned only by instructors only have an instructor count, the challenges mentioned only by students only have a student count, and the challenges mentioned by both instructors and students have both counts.
| **Challenge** | **Description** | **Instructor Count** | **Student Count** |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Diverse Mathematical Backgrounds & Learning Styles** | Students enter the course with varying levels of mathematical preparation and differing learning styles and preferences.                                               | 12 (75%)            | ---               |
| **Low Interest & Engagement**           | Student interest and engagement with course content is often limited, either due to a lack of interest in the material or insufficient opportunities for active engagement. | 7 (44%)             | ---               |
| **Potential Harm from Use of Technology** | Students may rely heavily on technology (e.g., LLMs, GenAI) to complete course content, which could hinder the development of independent problem-solving skills.     | 6 (38%)             | ---               |
| **Differing Course Expectations**       | Students find that course lectures are fast-paced and not very engaging nor interactive, with there often being a disconnect between the content delivered in lectures and what students are examined on. | ---                 | 9 (45%)           |
| **Difficulty with Starting & Structuring Proofs** | Students don't know how to start a proof (e.g., deciding what the appropriate proof technique would be), lose track of the steps and high-level goal in a proof, and are confused about the appropriate amount of detail and rigor their proofs should contain. | 12 (75%)            | 14 (70%)          |
| **Limited Personalized Support**        | Students do not receive personalized assistance with course content due to the large number of students and limited number of instructors.                             | 10 (63%)            | 7 (35%)           |
| **Inconsistent Grading and Feedback**   | Instructors struggle with grading students' proofs in a consistent, fair manner and providing detailed feedback on students' errors.                                  | 6 (38%)             | 6 (30%)           |

# Needs
Needs identified by CS instructors and CS students in undergraduate proof-based courses along with the number of instructors and students that mentioned each need. The needs mentioned only by instructors only have an instructor count, the needs mentioned only by students only have a student count, and the needs mentioned by both instructors and students have both counts.
| **Need** | **Description** | **Instructor Count** | **Student Count** |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Support Proof Conceptualization**     | Developing resources to help students conceptualize proofs (e.g., tracing steps, using visual aids, or offering guided walkthroughs of proof techniques).         | 5 (32%)             | ---               |
| **Incorporation of Group Assignments**  | Providing students the opportunity to discuss and collaborate with their peers/teaching staff on their course work.                                               | ---                 | 8 (40%)           |
| **More Examples & Practice**            | Providing a greater range of examples and practice problems to reinforce learning.                                                                                | 5 (32%)             | 14 (70%)          |
| **Access to Personalized Support**      | Providing immediate, individualized support and feedback as students work through course content (e.g., practice problems).                                       | 7 (44%)             | 14 (70%)          |
| **Improved Grading Practices**          | Establishing methods to ensure fair, consistent grading across all students' submissions along with the provision of quality feedback.                            | 5 (32%)             | 4 (20%)           |
| **Course-Level Adjustments**            | Adjusting course structure or prerequisites to accommodate students' diverse backgrounds (e.g., introducing students to the basics of proofs earlier in the curriculum, offering more advanced/more introductory versions of the same proof-based course) and finding ways to make the course content more engaging and interactive for students. | 4 (25%)             | 8 (40%)           |
| **Effective Integration of Technology** | Identifying ways to leverage technology (e.g., LLMs) within proof-based courses to either support instructor workload or enhance student learning in a meaningful way. | 4 (25%)             | 5 (25%)           |
