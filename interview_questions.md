# Interview Questions  

## **RQ1 – Proof Teaching**  
**What are the current practices, challenges, and needs of computer science instructors in proof-based courses and can technology support their teaching experiences?**  

### **Current Practices (15 Minutes)**  
- What proof-based CS courses have you taught between 2022-2024?  
- What proof concepts, techniques, and/or skills are used or covered in those courses?
- How are students assessed on proof-based skills/proof techniques in those courses? 
- What are your expectations for the proofs students write in those courses?  
  - *E.g.) What is the expected syntax, structure, and rigor?*  
- **Why these specific expectations?**  
- **What is your approach to teaching proofs in those courses?**  
  - *E.g.) Do you walk through proof examples during lecture or do you prefer providing students with an abstract template to that proof technique?*  
- Why this specific approach? 
- Are students provided with additional materials to supplement their learning of proofs before or after lectures? 
  - *E.g.) Are students provided with pre-lecture video clips covering a proof technique?*  
- Have you noticed any trends and/or changes in student attitude (e.g., engagement) and student behavior (e.g., performance) towards proofs in recent years?  
  - *E.g.) Due to changes in the curriculum or external factors like online learning, GAI, etc.?*  

### **Challenges & Technological Solutions (15 Minutes)**  
- Are there proof concepts/techniques/skills that students often find challenging?
- How do you help students overcome these challenges?
- Do these challenges differ for different student demographics?  
- Have you incorporated or considered incorporating any technology/tooling to assist with proof teaching and learning?  
  - *If so, which tools, and how do they enhance student learning?*  
  - *If not, why do you prefer traditional methods?*  
- Is there anything specific you are looking for in proof-based technology/tooling that is currently lacking?  
- What kinds of technological and/or non-technological support would help you improve your proof teaching experience and the students’ proof learning experience (e.g., new tools, curriculum changes, etc.)?

## **RQ2 – Proof Learning**  
**What are the current practices, challenges, and needs of computer science students in proof-based courses and can technology support their learning experiences?**  

### **Current Practices (20 Minutes)**  
- What proof-based courses have you taken at your institution?  
- How comfortable do you feel with the math topics covered in those courses? 
- Was there something that one of those courses did that you preferred over the others?  
- What proof concepts, techniques, and/or skills were used or covered in those courses?  
- How do your instructors teach proofs?  
- Is there anything that you would change about how proofs are taught?
- Was there ever a time when the method of teaching proofs didn’t align with your preferred learning style?  
  - *How did you handle this situation?*  
- How often do you obtain/seek feedback on your proof-writing from instructors, TAs, or peers? 
- How valuable/helpful do you find feedback on your proofs?  
  - *Do you prefer detailed step-by-step corrections or more general comments on the overall structure?*  
- How do you prepare for proof-based assignments or exams? 
  - *Do you work with peers, consult external resources, or focus on individual study?*  

### **Challenges & Technological Solutions (20 Minutes)**  
- What are the biggest challenges you face when learning and practicing proofs and how do you address them? 
  - *E.g.) Are these challenges more about understanding the logic, structuring the proofs, or formalizing the syntax?*  
- When you are stuck on a proof, what do you do to get unstuck? 
  - *Or give an example of something that was very frustrating when tackling proofs.*  
-*How long do you typically spend before seeking help, and from whom do you seek it?  
- What resources, technologies, or tools do you use to help you learn?  
- Which of these resources do you find most effective, and why?  
- Do any of these resources require any form of refinement to better support your learning?  
- What is something you feel is missing from your current learning toolkit?  
- Is there a particular feature or tool that you think would make proof-learning easier? 
- If a technological tool existed to help you learn proofs, what would you want it to do?  
  - *What key features would it have?*  
- Lastly, let’s finish on a “happy moment”. Tell me something that you loved about one of these proof-based courses. And why did you enjoy that aspect/time?
